A new ground floor for finance and government has arrived

Bits and bytes do not care about flesh and blood. We create them, and they work for us. Whether we use them to build a world that works for us, or a world that we work for, will be decided in the coming decades.

Join us at OpenQ localhost:berlin, an interactive symposium and hackathon at the intersection of blockchain, futurology, and policy.

Join a team to design a dystopic platform with blockchain - like social credit voting systems, digital serfdom, or automated surveillance states.

Or, join a team to design a utopic platform with blockchain - like anonymous medical data markets, incorruptible voting systems, or UBI.

Working code is a plus but not a requirement.

Awards will be given for the most dystopic and most utopic ideas.

Technical or non-technical, new or old, come by, grab a drink, and learn something new.

Speakers will be announced soon.

Weâ€™ll see you there.

localhost:berlin is hosted by OpenQ, a Github and crypto integrated marketplace for software engineers.

Food and drinks will be included. While waiting have fun with this: (hint thumbnail contains a secret)
